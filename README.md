### Connecting the inspiring and the aspiring together! ❤️

## Introduction

<p> Over the years, women have faced discrimination and gender bias in their careers.Often they drop out, in early stages of their career, due to lack of guidance, support and empathy. Also girls are often discouraged to have a career in STEM as opposed to boys.</p><br>

<br><p>But what would happen, if women got the much needed support, and guidance, in their careers? If there was this constant source of inspiration that could motivate them to have a career in technology, and break the age-old misconceptions that technology is more a "Men's" field.</p>

## Why CoffeeChat?

<p>Not only that, women at every stage of their career, can be benefitted. We believe that if these aspiring women got a chance to freely network with these inspiring women, they could instill new courage to move forward with their work, and this would infact be a step ahead to curb the bareers of gender bias.</p>
